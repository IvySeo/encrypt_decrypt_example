**Cryptography**
Cryptography is used to secure and protect data during communication. 
It is helpful to prevent unauthorized person or group of users from accessing any confidential data. 

**Encryption** a process which transforms the original information into an unrecognizable form.

**Decryption** a process of converting encoded/encrypted data in a form that is readable and understood by a human or a computer. 

**Public key** an encryption system which is based on two pairs of keys. Public keys are used to encrypt messages for a receiver.

**Sealed box**: designed to anonymously send messages to a recipient given its public key.
Only the recipient can decrypt these messages, using its private key.
